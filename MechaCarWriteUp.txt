According to the summary results, the ground clearance and vehicle length are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model.  The vehicle weight and vehicle length have a significant impact on mpg.  Additionally, the r-squared value has is 0.71 in our multiple linear regression model.
These linear plots indicate significant relationship between vehicle length and ground clearance on the mpg.

Summary of Suspension T test 
The summary of the t-test for the three lots of suspension manufacturing are in the table below.  The LOT3 variance which is greater than 100 indicates that does not meet the specification.
Manufacturer LOTMeanMedianVarianceSDLOT1150015001.151.07LOT21500149910.13.18LOT31499149822014.8
The mean of the suspension coil’s results are all however not significantly different from the specification of 1500 psi.
